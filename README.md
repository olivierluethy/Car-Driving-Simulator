# Car Driving Simulator
A simple car driving simulator in which you can drive different types of cars through different courses.

The program was developed by Olivier LÃ¼thy. 
Thanks to Alexander Denti who designed and created the tracks 1, 2, and 4 for this project.

## How to play
To be able to play the game, you have to move and control the car with the four keys on the keyboard, which are normally located at the bottom right.
